What are Go Templates and what can they be used for?
Go Templates are a framework for formatting strings with a specialized language, primarily used for server-side rendering. They allow inserting special tags within strings and can be used for creating HTML files with embedded Go code and expressions.



How do you include expressions in a Go Template?
Expressions in Go Templates are included using double curly braces {{ }}. These can interpolate values, call functions, and use pipelines to modify output.

How do you access values within a Go Template?
In a Go Template, you access values using the dot (.) notation. If a structure is passed to the template, you can access its properties by using dot followed by the property name, such as .Name.
But for the direct string passed we can use the . just only.

What methods are available for executing a Go Template?
Go Templates can be executed in multiple ways: converting to a string, writing directly to an output writer, or serving through a web server. Templates can also include logic like if conditions and range loops.

How do you create and parse a Go Template?
To create and parse a Go Template, use template.ParseFiles() to read a template file. You can then execute the template using Execute() method, passing a data object to render within the template. If the template is invalid, it will cause a panic.
