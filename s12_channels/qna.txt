What is a channel in Go and how does it facilitate communication between goroutines?
A channel is a special type of variable that acts as a pipeline for sending and receiving data between goroutines. It allows one goroutine to send a value, while another goroutine can wait and receive that value, effectively providing a mechanism for inter-goroutine communication.


How do you create a channel in Go?
To create a channel, use the chan keyword followed by the type of data the channel will handle, and initialize it using the make() function. For example: channelName := make(chan string) creates a channel that can send and receive string values.


What is the syntax for sending and receiving data through a channel?
To send data through a channel, use the arrow operator (<-) with the channel on the left side: channelName <- value. To receive data, place the channel on the right side of the arrow: receivedValue := <-channelName.


What is a buffered channel in Go?
A buffered channel allows storing a specified number of values before blocking. It is created by providing a second argument to make() that defines the buffer size. For example: bufferedChannel := make(chan string, 2) creates a channel that can hold two values before blocking.


Why is closing channels important when working with goroutines?
Closing channels helps prevent deadlocks and ensures proper resource management. By using the close() function on a channel, you signal that no more values will be sent, allowing receiving goroutines to complete their operations and preventing the program from hanging indefinitely.

What happens when a goroutine tries to send data to a non-buffered channel with no receiver?
The goroutine will block until a receiver is available
